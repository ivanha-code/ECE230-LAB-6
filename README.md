## Summary
We learned how to make a half adder, and a full adder
We learned how to connect 2 full adders with a wire
We learned how to implement a XOR in Verilog
We learned how to make a logical 0 in Verilog

## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
We would create more full adders then wire the additonal output to the C out.
### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
To determine the Sum.
### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
It would be 3, if its over 1 it would be in the overflow.
